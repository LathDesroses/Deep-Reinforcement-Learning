# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning# DRL Stock Trading

This project applies **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)** to financial markets, training AI agents to optimize trading strategies and compare their performance against traditional investment methods.

## Features
- Implements **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** and **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** for stock trading.
- Compares **AI-driven trading strategies** with **traditional methods** like **Buy & Hold and Momentum**.
- Incorporates **technical indicators** such as:
  - **SMA (Simple Moving Average)**
  - **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**
  - **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**
- Uses **real-world financial data** to test model adaptability and profitability.

## Metrics of Success
To evaluate the performance of our trading strategies, we use key financial metrics:
- **Return on Investment (ROI)**: Measures profitability.
- **Volatility**: Evaluates risk exposure.
- **Max Drawdown**: Largest drop in portfolio value from a peak.
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted return, balancing reward vs. risk.
- **Sortino Ratio**: Focuses on downside risk, penalizing only negative volatility.
- **Calmar Ratio**: Balances annualized return against maximum drawdown.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** 
- **PyTorch** 
- **Stable Baselines3** 
- **OpenAI Gym** 
- **Yahoo Finance API** 
- **Matplotlib & Pandas**
